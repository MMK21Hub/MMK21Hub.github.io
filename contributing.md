## Commit messages

Commit messages should be brief and summarize the changes that you've made.
Include any extra info in the extended commit message.

We have a set of emoji that you can use in your commit message, loosely based on [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/). They represent the type of commit that you've made.
Please only use one emoji per commit, and insert a space after the emoji.

Here is a list of emoji. THe most specific ones are at the top.
