## Features

- Familiar UI
- Mobile support
- Installable as a PWA (soon)

## Development tools

- **jQuery** helps us make async HTTPS requests easily, and provides a better way to manipulate the DOM.
- **Typescript** allows the usage of the latest Javascript features, and also adds type-checking to catch errors before they hit production.
- **Sass** lets us use features like nesting and loops in our CSS, and keeps our styles organized with partials.
- **Snowpack** lets us organize our project how we like, import JS libraries from NPM, and compiles everything into an optimized form ready for production.

## Structure

File and folder naming should be kept to lower-case-with-dashes.

|             Folder | Description                                            |
| -----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|   [assets](assets) | Static images etc                                      |
| [cypress](cypress) | Automated tests                                        |
|         [lib](lib) | Libraries not handled by npm                           |
|     [other](other) | Miscellaneous weirdness                                |
|         [src](src) | The project source code - this is where you want to be |

On the server, there's a `dist` folder containing compiled files for production. However, this does not exist on GitHub, instead it is generated by Snowpack on each deploy.

A `node_modules` folder is also generated when you `npm install` locally. You should not commit this folder.

### Other files

- `readme.md` - Project information and relevant links
- `contributing.md` - Information on how to contribute to the project
- `.gitignore` - A list of files that won't be committed to the repo

- `package.json` - Contains project metadata, dependencies, etc.
- `package-lock.json` - Automatically generated file to keep everyone's installed packages in sync

- `tsconfig.json` - Contains configuration for the Typescript compiler
- `snowpack.config.js` - Contains configuration for Snowpack
- `netlify.toml` - Contains configuration for Netlify deployment
- `cypress.json` - Contains configuration for Cypress tests
